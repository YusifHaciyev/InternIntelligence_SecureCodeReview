Secure coding is essential to prevent vulnerabilities like SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and weak authentication. Common problems include improper input validation, insecure data handling, and poor authentication practices. Best practices involve validating all inputs, using parameterized queries, encrypting sensitive data, and enforcing strong authentication mechanisms like multi-factor authentication (MFA). Following these ensures robust application security. 

In this assignment, there is a simple web application developed with Python Flask module for reviewing. The goal was to identify and mitigate common security issues, such as:

- Improper Password Hashing
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure Direct Object Access (IDOR)
- Weak Error Handling

During the task, provided recommendations for enhancing the overall security of the codebase. Fixed several vulnerabilities by implementing secure coding practices and applying parameterized queries, input validation, and other defense mechanisms.
